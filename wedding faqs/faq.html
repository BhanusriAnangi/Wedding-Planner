        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <button class="faq-question">How do you charge for services?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>This is the big question that everyone wants to know. After all, planners have their own ways of
                    charging for services. Some have packages and event rates, while others charge hourly or by the
                    service, and so forth. It’s less about how you charge and more about the fact that you’re willing to
                    disclose that to people to help them get the information that they need. Make sure that you’re clear
                    about all the options that you offer. Link to your services or pricing pages, too, to give people
                    even more insight and answers if they want them. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">Are deposits refundable?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>In wedding and event planning, deposits are a big part of the process. Venues, caterers, and other
                    event professionals have their own deposits and requirements for their rates. People will want to
                    know which deposits they can get back, as well as under what circumstances they can get a deposit
                    refunded. Every single venue and caterer will be different, and even your own planning deposits may
                    vary. It doesn’t matter—what matters is explaining it all to people so that they know what they are
                    getting into. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">What if there’s an emergency? Can we change the date or details without
                additional fees?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Some events have hiccups. Others have catastrophes. Almost always, there is at least one wedding on
                    your planning calendar that ends up needing to be rescheduled for one reason or another. This is
                    your chance to tell people all about how you can help them with that, and what your policies are.
                    Link to your cancellation page or policy page so that you can give people further details but keep
                    the answer here informative and brief. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">What is included in wedding planning services?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Some people aren’t familiar with wedding planning and might not know what to expect. Others may just
                    be aware that all planners have their own services and solutions. Use this question to explain
                    what’s generally included in wedding planning, and then go into a full explanation of what your
                    planning business does specifically. You can even explain custom planning solutions, if you offer
                    them, and invite people to contact you about getting an estimate or creating the custom plan for
                    their wedding so that they can get moving along. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">How much time do you need to plan?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Weddings generally take at least 9-12 months to plan properly, but as you know, that will depend on
                    the event itself. Some weddings can be planned in weeks. Others may take years to pull off
                    perfectly. Therefore, you’ll want to answer this question for your audience carefully. Let them know
                    that you need sufficient time to plan and explain what the time accounts for. This is where you can
                    explain the importance of booking a venue well in advance and planning ahead to make sure that there
                    are fewer compromises along the way.

                </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question"> Do you have a caterer or photographer reference or partnership?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>As a wedding planner, it’s likely that you have a lot of professional connections. You’ll want to
                    offer as many of those as you can. Not only does it help you provide a more comprehensive planning
                    experience, but it helps your peers get the business they need, too. Reciprocity is big in this
                    industry, and it can go a long way. Connect your audience to all of the resources that you provide,
                    including DJs, caterers, photographers, venues, and anyone else who they may need for their big day.
                    That way, you can assure them that they have less work to do and fewer decisions to make on their
                    own. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">How much experience do you have?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>People want to know that their wedding day is going to be perfect. Therefore, they’re not going to
                    hire a planner that just got started. Showcase your experience and expertise here. Tell people how
                    long you’ve been doing event planning and wedding planning and explain what kind of events you’ve
                    handled in the past. It’s not just about how many weddings you’ve planned or how many years you’ve
                    been at it—you should also explain the types of events you’ve covered and the vastness of your
                    experience so that people get a full picture of what you can do for their wedding day. </p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-question">Why do I need a wedding planner?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Here’s the million-dollar question that everyone asks. We put this here because it’s your chance to
                    sell your services and give people plenty of reasons as to why they need to work with you. A lot of
                    people assume they can plan their own wedding, but as you know that’s a lot of stress and work. A
                    wedding is a big moment in people’s lives. Even if they can do it themselves, they shouldn’t have
                    to. Planners can take the stress out of the day and let people get back to enjoying the experience
                    as they should.
